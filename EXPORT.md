# Export
Elodin is a language that is partially compiled. And works on very simple constructs:
* Application
* recursive let expressions
* lambda expressions
* and the last, yet most complex of them: import/export

Yet, while the import is quite easy, the export is one that has troubled me because well:
application, lambdas, and recursive let expressions work like a damn charm together.
How can I export stuff?

Philosophically, I think I'm a prick who wants everything super principled. And this time,
for the first time ever, I'll do the ducktaping shit
```
export (expr) 
  

```
